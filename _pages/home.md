# About Me

I am an freshman student in [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science.

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher in computer vision supervised by Professor [Kaiming He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaiming/) at MIT and robotics supervised by Professor [Huazhe Xu](https://hxu.rocks/) at IIIS, Tsinghua University. My research focuses on deep generative models and their applications in computer vision and robotics. 

Before college, I competed in the Physics Olympiad during high school and won a gold medal in the 39th Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO). Afterward, I spent a preparatory year at the IIIS, Tsinghua University, where I built a solid foundation in the mathematical principles underlying computer science and deep learning, as well as proficiency in practical tools such as PyTorch.

Although I am still a beginner, I am eager to explore various opportunities, either in academia or industry. I also enjoy engaging with people who share similar interests and chatting about anything from research ideas to personal experiences. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!

<!-- ## Selected Projects

- [**Speeding Up Diffusion Models with One-step Generators**](https://github.com/Hope7Happiness/6s978_project)

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">This is the final project for the seminar course <i>6.S978: Deep Generative Models</i> at MIT. In the project, we proposed a new method to speed up the training of diffusion models by using one-step generators. On toy experiments, this reduces NFE by half while maintaining the sample quality. We also wrote a <a href="/three_diff/">blog post</a>, explaining the motivation of the experiment from a higher perspective.</p>

- [**Knowledge Database**](https://github.com/Hidden-Hyperparameter/llm_project)

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">This is the project for the course <i>Introduction to Large Language Model Application</i> at IIIS, Tsinghua University. In the project, we apply LLMs to answer user questions given a folder containing documents as the context. We developed a tagging system, which make the search efficient even when the number of documents is large. We also support semantic search for multimodal documents, such as images and videos.</p>

- [**Deep Learning Study**](https://github.com/Hidden-Hyperparameter/DeepLearning)

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">In the repository, I tried to implement some classic and modern deep learning models from scratch. Instead of using extensive tricks and hyperparameter tuning, I tried to make each model implementation simple and easy to follow while giving reasonable results. I also tried to analyze what tricks are the most necessary for the model to work, so that I can find out the problem more quickly when a new model doesn't work as expected.
    <br><br>
    The repository is still under construction, and I will keep updating it with more models and analysis.</p> -->
